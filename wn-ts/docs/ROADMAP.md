## Superpower Operations: Advanced Use Cases

Go beyond simple lookups and unlock the full potential of WordNet with these "superpower" operations. These examples show how to combine different `wn-ts` functions to perform complex semantic analysis.

### 1. Conceptual Difference Analysis

**Problem**: You know "king" and "president" are both leaders, but what's the fundamental difference between them?

**Solution**: Find their common ancestor (hypernym) and then trace their differing relations to articulate the distinction.

**Example**:
```typescript
import { Wordnet } from 'wn-ts';
import { commonHypernyms } from 'wn-ts/taxonomy'; // Assumes a `commonHypernyms` utility exists

async function findDifference(word1: string, word2: string, wn: Wordnet) {
  const synsets1 = await wn.synsets(word1, 'n');
  const synsets2 = await wn.synsets(word2, 'n');

  if (synsets1.length === 0 || synsets2.length === 0) {
    return "One or both words not found.";
  }
  
  const common = await commonHypernyms(synsets1[0], synsets2[0], wn);
  
  // The first common hypernym is often a good starting point
  const commonConcept = common[0];

  // Now, find what makes them different by comparing definitions or other relations.
  const diff1 = synsets1[0].definitions[0]?.text;
  const diff2 = synsets2[0].definitions[0]?.text;
  
  console.log(`Both a "${word1}" and a "${word2}" are types of "${commonConcept.members[0]}".`);
  console.log(`The difference is:`);
  console.log(` - A "${word1}" is defined as: "${diff1}"`);
  console.log(` - A "${word2}" is defined as: "${diff2}"`);
}

// Result: Both a "king" and a "president" are types of "head of state".
// The difference is... (prints definitions)
```

### 2. Semantic Field Expansion

**Problem**: You want to generate a comprehensive list of all concepts related to "music" for a creative brainstorming tool.

**Solution**: Recursively traverse multiple relations (hyponyms, meronyms, related adjectives) starting from a seed concept.

**Example**:
```typescript
import { Wordnet } from 'wn-ts';

async function expandSemanticField(seedWord: string, wn: Wordnet) {
  const field = new Set<string>();
  const synsetsToExplore = await wn.synsets(seedWord, 'n');
  
  const exploreQueue = [...synsetsToExplore];
  const explored = new Set<string>();

  while (exploreQueue.length > 0) {
    const current = exploreQueue.shift();
    if (!current || explored.has(current.id)) continue;

    explored.add(current.id);
    current.members.forEach(m => field.add(m));

    for (const relation of current.relations) {
      // Explore children (hyponyms), parts (meronyms), etc.
      if (['hyponym', 'mero_part'].includes(relation.type)) {
        const relatedSynset = await wn.synset(relation.target);
        if (relatedSynset) {
          exploreQueue.push(relatedSynset);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  console.log(`Semantic field for "${seedWord}":`, Array.from(field).slice(0, 20));
}

// Result: Semantic field for "music": ['music', 'auditory sensation', 'vocal music', 'instrumental music', 'piece of music', 'musical composition', 'opus', 'genre', 'melody', 'harmony', 'rhythm', ...and so on]
```

### 3. Analogy Generation: `A` is to `B` as `C` is to `?`

**Problem**: You want to solve analogies programmatically, like "a queen is to a king as a woman is to a...?"

**Solution**: Identify the relationship between the first pair (`queen` -> `king`) and apply that same relationship to the third term (`woman`) to find the fourth.

**Example**:
```typescript
import { Wordnet } from 'wn-ts';

async function solveAnalogy(a: string, b: string, c: string, wn: Wordnet) {
  const synsetsA = await wn.synsets(a, 'n');
  const synsetsB = await wn.synsets(b, 'n');
  const synsetsC = await wn.synsets(c, 'n');
  
  if (!synsetsA.length || !synsetsB.length || !synsetsC.length) return "Words not found.";
  
  // Find the relation from A to B
  let foundRelation = null;
  for (const relation of synsetsA[0].relations) {
    if (relation.target === synsetsB[0].id) {
      foundRelation = relation;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (!foundRelation) return "No direct relation found between first pair.";

  // Apply the same relation to C to find D
  for (const relation of synsetsC[0].relations) {
    if (relation.type === foundRelation.type) {
      const synsetD = await wn.synset(relation.target);
      if (synsetD) {
        console.log(`"${a}" is to "${b}" as "${c}" is to "${synsetD.members[0]}"`);
        return synsetD.members[0];
      }
    }
  }
  return "Could not solve analogy.";
}

// Call with: solveAnalogy('queen', 'king', 'woman', wn)
// Result: "queen" is to "king" as "woman" is to "man"
